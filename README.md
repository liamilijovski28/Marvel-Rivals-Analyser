# Marvel Rivals Basics
In Rivals, two teams of 6 players battle each other for control of an objective. Each player plays a character which is one of three classes â€“ Duelist, Vanguard, & Strategist. Broadly speaking, Duelists job is to deal damage and defeat opponents, Vanguards are meant to absorb damage and stop their team from suffering and Strategists are meant to heal and buff their team.

Each game a user logs, they will submit the following statistics:

-Game mode (This project will support only either Quick Match or Ranked)

-Current Season (Is either 0, a positive integer, or a positive integer + 0.5)

-Character (who they played), 

-KOs (How many opponents they helped defeated through damage), Deaths (How many times they were defeated), 

-Assists (How many opponents they helped defeat through buffs), 

-Final Hits (How many opponents they did the final damage to defeat)

-Damage (Damage dealt to opponents)

-Damage Blocked (Damage the user took)

-Healing (Health restored by the user)
